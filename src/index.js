// reviews

// Dear excellent student,

// You have done amazing work! After launching your 
// project I was shocked and amazed that someone has worked outside 
// box and shown their creativity. I really liked your project and your 
// creativity. The theme is really good and user friendly. User experience 
// is really great and I enjoyed reviewing your project. However I feel bad 
// to inform you that you have not passed the project at the moment. Unfortunately 
// there are some errors and missing requirements. I have pointed out your missing 
// requirements and suggested how to fix them. Please go over them and update your 
// project with fixes and resubmit the project.
// If you have any question or doubt I recommend you to reach out to 
// your mentor as I understand that rubrics requirements or my 
// comments may not be easy to understand. I wish you good luck for the project.
// Keep learning and stay Udacious 




// Great job, you made it, congrats
// I love the creative UI design especially the swiper/carousel component
// Do you want to take the project to the next level later as a practice?
// Consider deploying it to a static web host like AWS, Netlify or Github Pages.
// you can also add popular features like book preview, sharing on social media, recording progress and so on.
// I'm sure you can come up with better ones and implement them all
